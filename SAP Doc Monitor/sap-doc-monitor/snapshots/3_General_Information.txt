General Information

Introduction to SAP Asset Performance Management

SAP Asset Performance Management is a cloud-based solution that enables plant managers and reliability engineers to measure and improve the performance of their assets. It helps in optimizing the maintenance strategies.

It allows you to do risk assessments of assets. Based on the assessments, you can apply best practice methodologies such as reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).

You can use these methodologies to determine the best maintenance and service strategies for your operating context. SAP Asset Performance Management helps to minimize maintenance costs and to reduce or mitigate risks stemming from the failure of critical assets.

SAP Asset Performance Management enables seamless integration fostering E2E processes, supporting industrial scale assets with an easy and flexible adoption by SAPs existing customer base.

This guide provides administrators with an overview of how to get started with the product and helps to get onboarded.
