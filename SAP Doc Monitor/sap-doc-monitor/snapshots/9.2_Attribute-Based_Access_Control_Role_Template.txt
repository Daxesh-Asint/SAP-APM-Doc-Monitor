Attribute-Based Access Control Role Template

The SAP Asset Performance Management provides predefined AccessControlAttributeProvider
role template for technical objects.

A role template is a description of one or more roles and any attributes that apply to those
roles. The SAP Asset Performance Management provides the AccessControlAttributeProvider
role template. This predefined template enables administrators to configure the mapping
to attributes and restrict access of a user to specific technical objects.

• Company Code
• Maintenance Plant
• Planning Plant
• Authorization Group
• Cost Center
Providing a value for the above attribute restricts the user’s access to Technical
Objects. And, when values are provided for multiple attributes, only the intersecting
set of Technical Objects are accessible to the user.

For example, a user is restricted to Company Code = 0076 (for 500 Technical Objects) and
Plant = 1001 (for 90 Technical Objects), and plant 1001 is part of company code 0076 in
the Org. Structure. In such a case, the user will be able to access only 90 Technical
Objects Assigned to plant 1001.

As an administrator, you can specify attributes in roles to refine the authorizations of the
business users. Depending on these attributes, business users with this role have
restricted access to data. To do this, refer to the topic Map Role Collections to User Attributes .
